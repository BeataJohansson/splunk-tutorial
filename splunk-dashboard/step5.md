Now its time to start adding visualizations to our dashboard! 
This will be a lot more fun!

Select "Start searching" and begin...

The search field will probably already have the required data:

 source="/mnt/build_logs.json" host="f65f7f52192a" index="demo_1" sourcetype=â€œ_json" 
 
And as you can see we already have some fields in our event.
If you want to have some more fields, you can select them from "intresting fields" by clicking on the "yes" tab.

For this tutorial, we will keep the default events and work with them!
