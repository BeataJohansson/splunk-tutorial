Now its time to start adding visualizations to our dashboard! 
This will be a lot more fun!

Select *Start searching* and begin...


The search field will probably already have the required data, but in case it does not, you should add the following:

*source="/mnt/build_logs.json" host="f65f7f52192a" index="demo_1" sourcetype=â€œ_json"* 
 
Each event has already some established fields, but if you would like to add some more its easily done by selecting one from *intresting fields* and by clicking on the "yes" tab.


Although this might be useful for other cases, in this tutorial we will keep our default fields!
