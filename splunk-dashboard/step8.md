Now for the last query!

**Query 3:**

Similarly to the previous step, we need to navigate back to the search page where we can add the last query.
This query will show the *timestamp*, *status* and *stage* for the last 5 jobs and will look like this:

"| sort -timestamp | table timestamp, stage, status | head 5"


After the query is executed, we will click onto the *statistics* tab and there you will see that the visualization is in the form of a table.
Now you can save this table the same way as previously done, to your existing dashboard.

<br />

After you have saved the table to your dashboard, select *view dashboard*. Here you want to click on "**...**" (which is located in the upper right corner) and select *Set as Home Dashboard*.
