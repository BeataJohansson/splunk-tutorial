To the search field, we can now start to add some queries that we want to visualize in our dashboard!

Query 1:

For the first query, add the following: " | stats avg(duration) by status " 

This query will calculate the average duration of each event sorted by status.
With this added we can go the "visualization" tab and select "Column chart" as a format.

Since we want this chart to be on our dashboard we will do the following:
1. Save to exisiting dahsboard
2. Choose the name of the dashboard you previously created
3. Add a suitable panel titen
4. Lastly, save to Dashboard
